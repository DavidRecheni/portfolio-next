    "I help early-stage startups build scalable products and engineering teams that move fast without accumulating technical debt. With deep experience in both enterprise software architecture and startup dynamics, I guide founders through critical technical decisions—from choosing the right tech stack to hiring their first engineers to establishing development processes that scale. I've architected systems that grow seamlessly from MVP to enterprise scale, implemented development workflows that maintain velocity as teams expand, and mentored engineering leaders through hypergrowth phases.",
